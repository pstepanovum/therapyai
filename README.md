## Modern Therapy Sessions with AI-Powered Insights

![TherapAI Logo](public/web-app-manifest-192x192.png)

TherapAI is a cutting-edge platform that bridges the gap between mental health professionals and their patients through technology. By recording, transcribing, and summarizing therapy sessions, TherapAI provides valuable insights and reference points that enhance the therapeutic journey.

## üß† About TherapAI

TherapAI was born from the recognition that both therapists and patients often struggle to remember important details from previous sessions. Therapists managing 20+ patients weekly can miss crucial information, while patients rarely take comprehensive notes during their sessions. TherapAI solves this problem by creating a secure, AI-enhanced system that captures, analyzes, and organizes therapy sessions for improved continuity of care.
